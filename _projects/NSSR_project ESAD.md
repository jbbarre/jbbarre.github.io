January 2023 - With the PROTECT office team, we had a week long workshop with students from the Ecole Supérieure d'Art et de Design of Grenoble-Valence (ESAD GV) and Alizée De Pin. We help students to appropriate some scientific knowledge related to Seal Level Rise and the cryosphere and make it more accessible to a wide audience.
