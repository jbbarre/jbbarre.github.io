Romain Millan, Jérémie Mouginot, Antoine Rabatel and Mathieu Morlighem worked together to produce this impressive dataset published in [Nature Geoscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00885-z) on the thickness and velocity of world's glaciers. I used Mapbox and its 3d feature to map the data and making it more accessible.
