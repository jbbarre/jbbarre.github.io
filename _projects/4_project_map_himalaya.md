    Topography of the Asian highlands region and ice-covered areas (area shown in blue). The main atmospheric circulations are described, in particular the westerly flows (Westerlies), and the two main monsoon systems, active mainly in summer: the South Asian monsoon (Indian monsoon) and the East Asian monsoon.
