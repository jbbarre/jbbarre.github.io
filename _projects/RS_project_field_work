Data acquisition is large part of the remote sensing work for the environmental applications. Not only the images or the point clouds but also the ground truth.

Here are some examples of fieldwork I have been involved in.



<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center">
           {% include figure.html path="assets/img/RS_field_work1.png" title="" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
        <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center">
           {% include figure.html path="assets/img/RS_field_work2.png" title="" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
