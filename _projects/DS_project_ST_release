Collaboration with [Romain Millan](https://sites.google.com/view/romainmillan/home?authuser=0&pli=1) based on the processing chain initiated by Romain and Jérémie MOUGINOT. This chain utilizes optical satellite images to compute the velocities of glaciers, enabling the analysis of data for almost 200,000 glaciers worldwide.

I collaborate with Romain to maintain the processing chain up-to-date.
