Collaboration with [Romain Millan](https://sites.google.com/view/romainmillan/home?authuser=0) based on the processing chain initiated by Romain and Jérémie MOUGINOT. This chain utilizes optical satellite images to compute the velocities of glaciers, enabling the analysis of data for almost 200,000 glaciers worldwide.

I collaborated with Romain to keep the processing chain updated. Specifically, I worked on the migration from a MySQL DB to a PostgreSQL DB: installation, configuration for compatibility with a cluster (GRICAD UGA), and script adaptation to reflect this migration (yes, SQL syntax does vary).
