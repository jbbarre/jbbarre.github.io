Collaboration with Eduardo Tusa Jumbo and its PhD supervision team including Jocelyn CHANUSSOT, Jean-Matthieu MONNET, Mauro DALLA MURA and myself.

In this study, we worked on the individual tree crown segmentation in a 3d Lidar points cloud. The segmentation is based on a mean shift algorithm adapted to 3d points cloud and the 3d shape of alpine trees.  details in [Individual Tree Segmentation Based on Mean Shift and Crown Shape Model for Temperate Forest.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9164904)
