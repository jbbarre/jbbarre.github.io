Antarctica is the fifth largest continent and probably the last to be recognised when properly mapped. The earth is indeed difficult to map on a flast surface as a screen or a book. The most commonly used maps of the Earth are focused on a 'not so bad' representation of the inhabited land areas. This leads to a compromise with a terrible consequence for Antarctica, whose shape is totally unrecognisable.
