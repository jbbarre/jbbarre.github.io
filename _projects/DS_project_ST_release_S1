Collaboration with [Romain Millan](https://sites.google.com/view/romainmillan/home?authuser=0), Bernd Scheuchl and [Eric Rignot](https://ps.uci.edu/node/2110) from University of California Irvine.

I worked on keeping the Sentinel-1 processing chain updated as well as developing new features. This provided me with an extraordinary opportunity to delve into the world of SAR imagery alongside highly experienced individuals. The mission was part of the MEaSUREs project, a NASAâ€™s Earth Science Program.

The chain represents over a decade of effort to develop a large-scale processing chain capable of handling terabytes of S1 data for ice motion assessment over Antarctica and Greenland. It has been developed using IDL, bash and Python languages. The process runs on dedicated UCI servers due to its computationally intensive nature and substantial disk space requirements.
