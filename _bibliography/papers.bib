	abstract = {Abstract. Hyperspectral images (HI) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) provide high resolution radiometric and geometric information for monitoring forests at individual tree crown (ITC) level. It has many important applications for sustainable forest management, biodiversity assessment and healthy ecosystem preservation. However, the integration of different remote sensing modalities is a challenging task for tree species classification due to different artifacts such as the lighting variability, the topographic effects and the atmospheric conditions of the data acquisition. The characterization of ITC can benefit from the extraction and selection of robust feature descriptors that solve these issues. This paper aims to investigate the integration of feature descriptors from HI and LiDAR by using the intra-set and inter-set feature importance for the semantic segmentation of forest tree species. A fusion methodology is proposed between high-density LiDAR data – (20 pulses m−2) and VNIR HI – (160 bands and 0.80 m spatial resolution) acquired on French temperate forests along an altitude gradient. The proposed scheme has three inputs: the field inventory information, the HI and the LiDAR data. Our approach can be described in nine stages: polygon projection, non-overlapping pixel selection, vegetation and shadow removal, LiDAR feature extraction, height mask, robust PCA (rPCA), feature reduction and classification. The overall accuracy of tree species classification at pixel-level was 68.9\% by using random forest (RF) classifier. Our approach showed that 74.0\% of trees were correctly assigned overall, by having conifer species such as Norway Spruce (Picea abies) with a producer’s accuracy of 97.4\%.},

	abstract = {Coastal areas are highly diverse, ecologically rich, regions of key socio-economic activity, and are particularly sensitive to sea-level change. Over most of the 20th century, global mean sea level has risen mainly due to warming and subsequent expansion of the upper ocean layers as well as the melting of glaciers and ice caps. Over the last three decades, increased mass loss of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has also started to contribute significantly to contemporary sea-level rise. The future mass loss of the two ice sheets, which combined represent a sea-level rise potential of ∼65 m, constitutes the main source of uncertainty in long-term (centennial to millennial) sea-level rise projections. Improved knowledge of the magnitude and rate of future sea-level change is therefore of utmost importance. Moreover, sea level does not change uniformly across the globe and can differ greatly at both regional and local scales. The most appropriate and feasible sea level mitigation and adaptation measures in coastal regions strongly depend on local land use and associated risk aversion. Here, we advocate that addressing the problem of future sea-level rise and its impacts requires (i) bringing together a transdisciplinary scientific community, from climate and cryospheric scientists to coastal impact specialists, and (ii) interacting closely and iteratively with users and local stakeholders to co-design and co-build coastal climate services, including addressing the high-end risks.},

	abstract = {The choice of a natural risk prevention strategy must be considered at the scale of a territory in order to take into account all its components. Since 2015, France has developed integrated natural risk management (INRM) approaches in Alpine territories. The challenge of INRM lies in the definition and implementation of innovative projects for initiating synergies with respect to natural risks while seeking to increase resilience through the new and different involvement of the territorial actors. The Baronnies Provençales Regional Nature Park is one of the pilot territories for the operational implementation of this approach, with a particular focus on forest-based solutions. For this reason it has been chosen as the French Pilot Action Region (PAR) of the Interreg Alpine Space project GreenRisk4Alps. In this article we present an example of good practice related to the benefit of large-scale rockfall risk modeling, the analysis of potential cascading effects and the added value of a territorial perspective.},
