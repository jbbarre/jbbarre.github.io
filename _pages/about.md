I am an engineer who holds a PhD in instrumentation, signal processing, and imaging for environmental applications. With over 12 years of research experience, I have developed expertise in geospatial data processing, analysis and visualization. Additionally, I am involved in collaborating on the development of machine learning-based solutions for Earth science applications.

As an individual, I am a curious problem-solver who enjoys exploring diverse areas to create innovative solutions that have an impact. I value working in an open-minded environment that promotes collaboration and inspires creativity.
