Geospatial Data

I'm an engineer with a PhD in instrumentation, signal, and imaging for environmental applications with over 12 years of experience in research. The past years, I have specialized in the development of geospatial data analysis and visualization applications. I also collaborate on the development of machine learning based solutions for Earth science applications.

Personally, I am a curious problem-solver who loves exploring different areas to provide innovative solutions that make a difference. I appreciate working in an open-minded environment, as it fosters collaboration and encourages creativity.
